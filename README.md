# aircrack-ng
Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

## Objective :
Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security but we have performed:
- Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)

## Features:
- The code is structured in a menu driven format where the user can select the type of appraoch to be used. They are
  - BruteForce Method: In this method we have tried to compute all the possible combinations and tried to connect to the network(wifi).
  - Most commonly used passwords: In this method we have tried check the most commonly used passwords  and tried to connect to the network(wifi).
## To Run The Project:
- Install Python3
- Pip install pywifi
- Pip install comtypes
- Before running the code make sure you download human.txt from the given link(Used in most commonly used passwords) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytxkG9NHTnAPBQ6iQbldj5yLMA6C7yWJ/view> or [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytxkG9NHTnAPBQ6iQbldj5yLMA6C7yWJ/view)
- Run the wificracker.py file if you want to use both bruteforce method and most commonly used passwords
- Else run bruteForce.py
